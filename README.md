DateFirst is a dating site that is on another level. It is aimed at all .NET ninjas, past, present and future.
The great thing about it is that here you can find someone whose IQ will have been tested.
For the visiting user, we have all the userprofiles available to view and sort by Gender, EyeColour, HairColour and StarSign. Yes StarSign, because some programmers belive in them.

On the homepage we also have live groupchat for users who are currently on the page, however to access this feature, the user needs to be logged in.

They can also visit the profile page of each user, read their additional information such as Department, Salary, Weight, AboutMe.
They could even check out their latest images, neatly organized in a small gallery(hosted in Dropbox). However they cannot send them chat messages or flirt with them.

When some flirts with you, a notification pops up to both the flirter and the flirtee.

To register you need to provide FirstName, LastName, Email and Password. A default avatar is assigned to each new user. By accessing my profile all additionall information as well as gallery uploads is right at you fingertips.

This project idea was developed and delivered by *Team Pan* - Telerik Academy 2015-2016.
